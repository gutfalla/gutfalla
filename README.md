- 👋 Hi, I’m @gutfalla. I am a political scientist and Master of Public Policy.

- 👀 I’m interested in Advanced Research Methods, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Large Language Models, and Artificial Intelligence. I'm also interested in Government, Public Policy, Comparative Politics, Political Theory, and International Relations.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Data Engineering, specifically how to create stream and batch pipelines using tools such as Docker, Spark, Kafka, GCS, and BigQuery.

  I aim to apply my machine learning knowledge through transformers on datasets from government sources, public APIs, or other sources of public data. I want to deploy the results using tools such as interactive dashboards that visualize key indicators and trends relevant to specific policy areas.These dashboards could provide policymakers and stakeholders with real-time insights to inform decision-making and resource allocation.

  I would like to do this using R, Python, and SQL.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the implementation of Artificial Intelligence for the common good and research on the allocation of power in a datafied world.
